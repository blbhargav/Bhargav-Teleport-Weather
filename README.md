Here Enter the new city name. Click submit. Then the new city will be added to list of cities. Scroll down the cities list to see the newly added city. In home screen too the new city will be appear at the end of the cities list.
> Note:- Entering the already existing city name will give error. This is done to restrict duplication of data.

#### Setings Page
<img src="/screenshots/Settings.jpg" width="150">
Clicking on bottom navigation panels menu "SETTINGS" will navigate to this page.
Here 2 options will be there. One is "Light" and another is "Dark". By default "Light" will be selected.
The purpose of these options it to change the app theme. Click on "Dark" option to see the magic. Our app screen colors will change to dark(see below image).

You can undo this operation by selecting "Light" option if you don't like this theme ðŸ˜”.

That's it. I have recorded all these things in a [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VnWhlmatXPgKb8is4ClfE-QHe2JA8ekp/view?usp=sharing).
Install the [APK](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M7j0oUuHbLMyilHUYZpgouGb1Z1lbUCw/view?usp=sharing) and check my app.
